***
## DISCLAIMER
### `DO NOT` use my website for phishing, fraud OR any other illegal activity! I won't be responsible for any act.
### If you want, YOU CAN use this as your personal website (of course change it up a bit).
***
## CONTRIBUTING
### To contribute:
### • Go to an html file, let's say `index.html`;
### • Scroll all the way down to the end of the file (obviously before the end tags, or where you want to add the contribution);
### • Create a `<div>` and add a comment.
### The comment `MUST` include your name, what you added, and if you want, why you added those features. Example:
### `<! --Name's contribution - made the website better.-->`
### `<p>blah blah</p>`
### `<script> some javascript </script>`
### `<! --End of name's contribution.-->`
### Post Scriptum: I added the space between `!` and `--` because otherwise Github won't let me display the contents of the comment.
### • Then make a `pull` request and wait.
### If I accept the pull request, I'll merge it with the `Master` branch!
