			<h1>About GoDzM4TT3O</h1>
            <h4>Who is GoDzM4TT3O?</h4>
            <h5>GoDzM4TT3O is an Italian boy who likes programming, gaming, and the English language (I'm better than most people in Italy! - I've got a certification, Cambridge English B2 certificate, which I got when I was 13 years old.)</h5>
            <h4>What programming languages do you often use?</h4>
            <h5>I often use php, mysql, css, javascript (HTML is not a programming language).</h5>
            <h5>I also use quite often the terminal (bash), so I'd say I'm an amateur programmer.</h5>
            <h4>What OS do you use? Why?</h4>
            <h5>I use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x64 on a Lenovo B50-10 laptop. I use Ubuntu specifically because:</h5>
            <h5>1) It's updated regularly; 2) It's debian based; 3) It's really easy to work with it; 4) I like how I can customize it.</h5>
            <h4>Do you think that Windows is better than Linux?</h4>
            <h5>I think that, whichever flavor of Linux you use, from OpenBSD, to Red Hat Linux, you're still a Linux user, and nobody can make fun of you, because Windows is inferior than Linux.</h5>
            <h5>From a security point of view, Windows definitely has a lot more vulnerabilities than Linux, plus, it's closed source, while, on the other hand, Linux is open source, which means that anybody can contribute to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">improve the Linux kernel.</a></h5>
            <h5>Instead, from a gaming point of view, Windows has more games developed for it, but that doesn't mean it's better, since you can also run windows executables (.exe) on Linux, via WINE, PlayOnLinux, etc.</h5>
            <h4>Has somebody taught you how to code?</h4>
            <h5>In reality, no. Just like English: over the course of a few years, without specifically looking to learn, nor improve my levels, I've gained quite a lot of knowledge on these two subjects.</h5>
            <h5>Not because I'm a nerd or something (well, kind of), but because these things fascinate me, the "magic" of computers that I've always wanted to understand.</h5>
            <h5>Also, I talked about being really good at speaking English: why does that matter? Well, it matters because, without being able to speak/understand English, I wouldn't be here writing this.</h5>
            <h5>I speak Italian, English and French. English is a really important language if you want to speak to anyone, honestly. Computer programming also requires quite a bit of English knowledge.</h5>
