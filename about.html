	<h1>About GoDzM4TT3O</h1>
	<h4>Who is GoDzM4TT3O?</h4>
	<h5>GoDzM4TT3O is an Italian dude who likes programming, gaming (not so much nowadays), working out, and the English language (I'm better than most people in Italy! - I've got a certification, Cambridge English B2 certificate, which I got when I was 13 years old.)</h5>
	<h5>I currently am in high school, and I'm looking forward to get a Linux SysAdmin certification. I don't think I'll go to university. </h5>

	<h4>What programming languages do you often use?</h4>
	<h5>I often use php, mysql, css, javascript (HTML is not a programming language).</h5>
	<h5>I also often use the terminal.</h5>

	<h4>What OS do you use?</h4>
	<h5>I use Ubuntu on a Lenovo B50-10 laptop. I also have Arch Linux 32 bit on an older laptop.</h5>
	<h5>Instead of using GNOME (bloat) I use i3wm, which is a Window Manager (not a Desktop Environment) but it is very light and uses much less RAM than GNOME.
	<h5>You can find my dotfiles <a href="https://godzm4tt3o.js.org/dotfiles">here.</a></h5>
		
	<h4>Has somebody taught you how to code?</h4>
	<h5>In reality, no. Just like English: over the course of a few years, without specifically looking to learn, nor improve my levels, I've gained quite a lot of knowledge on these two subjects.</h5>
	<h5>Not because I'm a nerd, but because these things fascinate me, the "magic" of computers that I've always wanted to understand.</h5>
	<h5>Also, I talked about being really good at speaking English: why does that matter? Well, it matters because, without being able to speak/understand English, I wouldn't be here writing this.</h5>
	<h5>I speak Italian, English and French. English is a very important language if you want to speak to anyone, honestly. Computer programming also requires quite a bit of English knowledge.</h5>
